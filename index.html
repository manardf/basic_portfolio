    <title>About Shahad the Artist!</title>
</head>
<body>
 <h1>Know More!</h1>   
 <p><a href="./shahad.html">Shahad</a> is an artist who grew up in Oman, but had the experience in experiencing Egypt! <br />
    She knew she loved art ever since when she was young, but did not know what it means, but what she did do is experiment art in different mediums without knowing. <br />
    It took her a journey of travelling to the UK, studying engineering, until she figured out what she liked! <br />
    She decided she is no longer going to do engineering, and she will pursue what she's passionate about! Something that is not encouraged enough. <br />
    Even when she was doing engineering, she was experimenting with <a href="../3.0 Images/3.1 Doodles/doodles.html">doodles</a> which I think she found more joy in than maths and numbers and stuff. <br />
